  abstract = {In this work, we propose StreamDD, a data streams clustering algorithm that explicitly detects concept drifts. We will mainly focus on Sudden and Incremental concept drifts. StreamDD is based on CluStream and Page-Hinkley test. Its effectiveness and robustness are evaluated through a series of experiments on generated data streams for which we simulate drifts ( Incremental, Sudden and Mixed ). The comparison of StreamDD with DenStream, a density based stream clustering algorithm, shows that our algorithm ensures good quality clustering while being able to detect concept drifts.}

The authors present and discuss the application of KDD in these situations prior to the presentation of an analytical method based on fuzzy logic and evolutionary algorithms, developed to analyze marketing databases and uncover relationships among variables. A detailed implementation on a pre-existing data set illustrates the method.}
