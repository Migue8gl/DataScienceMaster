  abstract  = {Genetic algorithms have been used in science and engineering as adaptive algorithms for solving practical problems and as computational models of natural evolutionary systems. This brief, accessible introduction describes some of the most interesting research in the field and also enables readers to implement and experiment with genetic algorithms on their own. It focuses in depth on a small set of important and interesting topics -- particularly in machine learning, scientific modeling, and artificial life -- and reviews a broad span of research, including the work of Mitchell and her colleagues. The descriptions of applications and modeling projects stretch beyond the strict boundaries of computer science to include dynamical systems theory, game theory, molecular biology, ecology, evolutionary biology, and population genetics, underscoring the exciting "general purpose" nature of genetic algorithms as search methods that can be employed across disciplines. An Introduction to Genetic Algorithms is accessible to students and researchers in any scientific discipline. It includes many thought and computer exercises that build on and reinforce the reader's understanding of the text.}

In this chapter, we give an overview of the various kinds of evolutionary algorithms, such as genetic algorithms, evolutionary strategy, evolutionary and genetic programming, differential evolution, and coevolutionary algorithms, as well as several other bio-inspired approaches, like swarm intelligence and artificial immune systems. After elaborating on the methodology, we provide numerous examples of applications in astronomy and geoscience and show how these algorithms can be applied within a distributed environment, by making use of parallel computing, which is essential when dealing with Big Data.}

The first part of this chapter is devoted to the revision of the basic components for the design of GAs. We illustrate this construction process through its application for solving three widely known optimization problems as knapsack problem, traveling salesman problem, and real-parameter optimization. The second part of the chapter focuses on the study of diversification techniques that represent a fundamental issue in order to achieve an effective search in GAs. In fact, analyzing its diversity has led to the presentation of numerous GA models in the literature. Similarly, the hybridization with other metaheuristics and optimization methods has become a very fruitful research area. The third part of the chapter is dedicated to the study of these hybrid methods. In closing, in the fourth part, we outline the wide spectrum of application areas that shows the level of maturity and the wide research community of the GA field.},

There are n binary variables and 2p constraints. The numerical experiments are made on a randomly generated set. In view of its integer linear programming formulation, tests are run in CPLEX. This NP-hard problem uses a set of vectors rather than a set of numbers. The presented experimental results indicate that the generalized problem is much harder than the initial problem.}

Also, an efficient memetic algorithm (MA) heuristic is developed to solve the multidimensional multi-way number partitioning problem obtained by combining a genetic algorithm (GA) with a powerful local search (LS) procedure. The performances of our memetic algorithm have been compared with the existing numerical results obtained by CPLEX based on an integer linear programming formulation of the problem.

MDTWNPP is a generalization of a Two-way Number Partitioning Problem (TWNPP), where a set of vectors is partitioned rather than a set of numbers. The simple k-swap neighborhoods allow an effective shaking procedure in the VNS search. The attraction–repulsion mechanism of EM is extended with a scaling procedure, which additionally moves EM points closer to local optima. Both VNS and EM use the same local search procedure based on 1-swap improvements. Computational results were obtained on 210 standard instances. Direct comparison with results from the literature confirm the significance of applying these methods to MDTWNPP.}

In the last few years, the combination of GRASP with path relinking (PR) has emerged as a highly effective tool for finding high-quality solutions for several difficult problems in reasonable computational time. However, in most of the cases, this hybridisation is limited to the variant known as interior PR. Here, we couple GRASP with the “exterior form” of path relinking and perform extensive experimentation to evaluate this variant. In addition, we enhance our GRASP with PR method with a novel local search method specially designed for the MDTWNP problem. Our computational experiments show the superiority of this approach compared with the previous best method for MDTWNP and with alternative methods for this problem that use other forms of PR.}

abstract = {In this article, we propose a novel and effective evolutionary algorithm for the challenging combinatorial optimization problem known as Multidimensional Two-Way Number Partitioning Problem (MDTWNPP). Since the MDTWNPP has been proven to be NP-hard, in the recent years, it has been increasingly addressed by means of meta-heuristic approaches. Nevertheless, previous proposals in literature do not make full use of critical problem information that may improve the effectiveness of the search. Here, we bridge this gap by designing an improved Memetic Algebraic Differential Evolution (iMADEB) algorithm that incorporates critical information about the problem. In particular, iMADEB evolves a population of candidate local optimal solutions by adopting three key design concepts: a novel non-redundant bit-string representation which maps population individuals one-to-one to MDTWNPP solutions, a smoother local search operator purposely designed for the MDTWNPP landscapes, and a self-adaptive algebraic differential mutation scheme built on the basis of the Lévy flight concept which automatically regulates the exploration-exploitation trade-off of the search. Computational experiments have been conducted on a widely accepted benchmark suite for the MDTWNPP with a twofold purpose: analyzing the robustness of iMADEB and compare its effectiveness with respect to the state-of-the-art approaches to date for the MDTWNPP. The experimental results provide important indications about iMADEB robustness and, most importantly, clearly show that iMADEB is the new state-of-the-art algorithm for the MDTWNPP.}
