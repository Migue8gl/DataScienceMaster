  abstract  = {Genetic algorithms have been used in science and engineering as adaptive algorithms for solving practical problems and as computational models of natural evolutionary systems. This brief, accessible introduction describes some of the most interesting research in the field and also enables readers to implement and experiment with genetic algorithms on their own. It focuses in depth on a small set of important and interesting topics -- particularly in machine learning, scientific modeling, and artificial life -- and reviews a broad span of research, including the work of Mitchell and her colleagues. The descriptions of applications and modeling projects stretch beyond the strict boundaries of computer science to include dynamical systems theory, game theory, molecular biology, ecology, evolutionary biology, and population genetics, underscoring the exciting "general purpose" nature of genetic algorithms as search methods that can be employed across disciplines. An Introduction to Genetic Algorithms is accessible to students and researchers in any scientific discipline. It includes many thought and computer exercises that build on and reinforce the reader's understanding of the text.}

  abstract  = {Knowledge discovery from data typically includes solving some type of an optimization problem that can be efficiently addressed using algorithms belonging to the class of evolutionary and bio-inspired computation. In this chapter, we give an overview of the various kinds of evolutionary algorithms, such as genetic algorithms, evolutionary strategy, evolutionary and genetic programming, differential evolution, and coevolutionary algorithms, as well as several other bio-inspired approaches, like swarm intelligence and artificial immune systems. After elaborating on the methodology, we provide numerous examples of applications in astronomy and geoscience and show how these algorithms can be applied within a distributed environment, by making use of parallel computing, which is essential when dealing with Big Data.}

abstract="This chapter presents the fundamental concepts of genetic algorithms (GAs) that have become an essential tool for solving optimization problems in a wide variety of fields. The first part of this chapter is devoted to the revision of the basic components for the design of GAs. We illustrate this construction process through its application for solving three widely known optimization problems as knapsack problem, traveling salesman problem, and real-parameter optimization. The second part of the chapter focuses on the study of diversification techniques that represent a fundamental issue in order to achieve an effective search in GAs. In fact, analyzing its diversity has led to the presentation of numerous GA models in the literature. Similarly, the hybridization with other metaheuristics and optimization methods has become a very fruitful research area. The third part of the chapter is dedicated to the study of these hybrid methods. In closing, in the fourth part, we outline the wide spectrum of application areas that shows the level of maturity and the wide research community of the GA field.",
